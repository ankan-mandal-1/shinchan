            Crayon Shin-chan, also known as Shin Chan, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui. It follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke "Shin" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends and is set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan.</p>

<p>Crayon Shin-chan first appeared in 1990 in a Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which was published by Futabasha. Due to the death of author Yoshito Usui, the manga in its original form ended on September 11, 2009. A new manga began in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui's team, titled New Crayon Shin-chan.</p>
<p>
An animated television adaptation began airing on TV Asahi in 1992 and is still ongoing on several television networks worldwide. It has over 1000 episodes and 26 full-length movies. The show has been dubbed in 30 languages which aired in 45 countries. More than 148 million copies of the manga have been sold worldwide, counting 15 countries, making it the tenth best-selling manga series.</p>
<p>
An anime spin-off titled Super Shiro, produced by Science SARU, premiered in 2019.[8] The story follows the Noharas' family dog, Shiro, becoming a superhero and protecting the legendary bone "Bobobobobone" from the evil inventor dog, Dekapoo and his ambitions of world domination.</p>
